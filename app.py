    * **Purpose:** To predict future values of the dependent variable or to understand the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.
    * **Assumptions:** For reliable results, linear regression assumes a linear relationship, independence of observations, homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals), and normally distributed residuals.
    * **Coefficient of Determination ($r^2$):** Often displayed alongside regression results, $r^2$ indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variable(s). A higher $r^2$ suggests a better fit of the model to the data.

st.markdown(
    """
    Here's how regression and correlation analysis can be applied in an accounting context:

    1.  **Cost Behavior Analysis:** To understand and predict how different types of costs (e.g., variable, fixed, semi-variable) behave in relation to changes in activity levels (e.g., production units, sales volume). This is crucial for budgeting and cost control.
    2.  **Budgeting and Forecasting:** Developing more accurate budgets and financial forecasts by identifying the relationship between key financial variables (e.g., sales revenue and advertising spend, or production volume and direct materials cost).
    3.  **Variance Analysis:** Investigating the causes of variances by correlating operational factors (e.g., machine hours, labor efficiency) with cost deviations to pinpoint areas for improvement.
    4.  **Sales Forecasting:** Predicting future sales volumes and revenues based on historical data and correlated factors like marketing expenditure, economic indicators, or seasonal trends.
    5.  **Overhead Absorption Rate Calculation:** Establishing a more accurate basis for absorbing overheads by analyzing the relationship between overhead costs and relevant cost drivers (e.g., direct labor hours, machine hours).
    6.  **Break-Even Analysis:** Enhancing break-even calculations by using regression to better estimate fixed and variable cost components from mixed costs.
    7.  **Performance Evaluation:** Assessing the relationship between management actions (independent variables) and financial outcomes (dependent variables) to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies or operational changes.
    8.  **Pricing Decisions:** Analyzing the correlation between price changes and sales volume (price elasticity of demand) to inform optimal pricing strategies.
    9.  **Working Capital Management:** Forecasting working capital needs by understanding the relationship between sales levels and components like accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.
    10. **Fraud Detection and Risk Assessment:** Identifying unusual patterns or anomalies in financial data by looking for deviations from expected correlations between different accounts or transactions, potentially signaling fraudulent activities or areas of higher financial risk.
